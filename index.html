    <h1>Benefits of Honey</h1>

        <div>
            <!--First Item in column 1-->
            <h3>Rich in accusantium</h3>
            <p>Many of us enjoy honey and incorporate it into our daily, whether as a 
                natural sugar substitute for our coffee of simply as a sweet treat. But 
                specific honey varietals known as "active" honeys have also been utilised
                throughout history for their antibacterial and medicinal properties. 
            </p></div>
        <div>
            <!--First Item in column 2-->
            <h3>Natural Cough Medicine</h3>
                <p>Honey is a time-honored remedy for a sore throat.  According to one study,
                    it can also relieve coughs more effectively than OTC medications that 
                    contains dextromethorphan (DM), a cough suppresant.  You can create
                    your own remedy at home by mixing up 2 teaspoons of honey with 
                    herbal tea or warm water and lemon
                </p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <!--First Item in column 3-->
            <h3>Lowers Blood Pressure</h3>
                <p>Blood pressure is an important risk factor for heart disease, and honey
                    may help lower it.  This is because it contains antioxidants compounds that 
                    have shown modest reductions in blood pressure from consuming honey.
                </p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <!--Second Item in column 1-->
            <h3>Improves Cholestoral</h3>
                <p>Studies have shown that consuming honey lowers LDL (bad) cholesterol 
                    by 6-11% and lowers triglyceride levels by as much as 11%.  Honey may
                    also increase HDL (good) cholesterol by about 3%.
                </p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <!--Second Item in column 2-->
            <h3>Improve Heart Health</h3>
                <p>It's high in antioxidants, such as phenolic acids and flovonoids, which may
                    support better health.  Small studies in humans show honey's antioxidants 
                    could improve cholesterol levels, which could help decrease the risk
                    for heart disease, although larger long-term studies are needed to confirm
                    those findings.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <!--Second Item in column 3-->
            <h3>Antibacterial properies</h3>
                <p>Honey contains hydrogen peroxide, which may account for some of its 
                    antibacterial properties. It also has a high sugar content, honey has a low pH level.
                    This works to pull moisture away from bacteria, causing the bacteria to get
                    dehydrated and die off.

            <p><i> I have been trying to enbrace a more holistic lifestyle and 
                focusing on having a more natural, low processing and 
                preservative diet.  I have opted to reduce my sugar intake and 
                change out to honey.  I feel more assure that MTA honey valley is 
                of the purest form as I have seen the GMPs employed by this 
                company and have confidence in their ethical practices.  I also 
                used honey in my skin care routine and have been seeing big 
                positive changes

            <!--Second Testimonial-->
            <p><i> I have been a big user of honey for years now for several reasons,
                health being number 1. And over the years I have tried numerous
                brands of honey and I was always satisfied with the quality of them,
                until I tried MTA Honey Valley.  The quality of Honey Valleys's 
                honey is second to none.  Ever since I tried the first bottle
                I have not used another brand since and I have absolutely no intention
                of using any.  The product quality is exceptional and the customer 
                service from the MTA Honey valley team is top notch. MTA 
                Honey Valley, You Guys are the best!!!
